# `stages` is a list of strings that represent the different stages of a hangman game. Each string in
# the list is a visual representation of the hangman at a particular stage of the game, with the first
# string representing the initial stage and the last string representing the final stage (when the
# hangman is fully drawn). The strings are formatted using ASCII art to create a visual representation
# of the hangman.
